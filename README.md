towerGameFrame
==============

After a week of playing Star Wars: Tiny Deathstar I begun to think that this game has simple dynamics, and could be recreated with jQuery, thus I present you:

A basic jQuery tower management game framework

This is not intended to be fully qualified game, but can serve as a base, upon which can be improved greatly.

At this stage no real documentation is need, but will create one later on..

The roadmap can be found in the Issues section :)

If you use this in your project, please notify me so that I can check it out, and have some fun with it ;)
